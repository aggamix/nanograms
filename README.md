# Hangman

Hi, my name is Nikita, and Iâ€™m a beginner frontend developer. This is my new game where I start thinking in **JavaScript** and discover more possibilities of using this language.

**Nonograms** are logic puzzles where you need to color the cells of a grid to create a picture. The numbers next to the rows and columns indicate how many consecutive cells should be filled in each row or column. There must always be at least one empty cell between such groups of filled cells.

## The game has several features:
- Difficulty selection with different puzzles (currently, only the 'easy' level is available);
- Saving previous results;
- Automatic puzzle solving;
- A timer that starts automatically after the first click on the game grid;
- Resetting the game field and timer;
- Random puzzle selection;
- Light theme selection for the game;
- Sound effects when clicking on a cell.

If you click on a cell and change your mind, simply click on it again ðŸ˜Š
